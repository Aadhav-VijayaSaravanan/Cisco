# ASCII Character Binary Representation

This Python script takes a word as input, counts the number of characters in the word, and then prints the binary representation of each character using a predefined ASCII dictionary.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

3. Enter a word when prompted.

4. The script will display the binary representation of each character in the input word.

## ASCII Dictionary

The script uses a dictionary (`ASCII`) to map characters to their binary representations. You can find this dictionary in the code file.

## Example

```bash
Enter a word: Hello, World!
Binary representation:
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001
