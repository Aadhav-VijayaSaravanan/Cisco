# Cisco
"Cisco" is a Python script that converts input words to ASCII binary, swaps letter cases, and counts words.

## About

**Cisco** is a versatile Python script with three core functions for processing input words. First, it converts words into their corresponding ASCII binary representations, breaking down each character into a series of 0s and 1s according to the ASCII encoding standard. This is useful for encoding and decoding text in binary format.

The second function of **Cisco** is the swap caser, which changes the case of characters in input words. Uppercase letters become lowercase, and lowercase letters become uppercase, providing a quick way to transform text for various purposes.

Additionally, **Cisco** incorporates a word counter that counts the number of words within the input text. It identifies word boundaries based on spaces or other delimiters, enabling users to keep track of the word count in a given text.

In essence, **Cisco** is a Python script that combines these three functions, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of text processing and analysis tasks. Whether you need to convert text to binary, manipulate letter cases, or count words, "Cisco" offers a convenient and efficient solution.
